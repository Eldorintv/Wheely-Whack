But be cautious, the car gets faster and faster!

### About
This project is a combination of the courses Cloud-Gaming and Real-Time Computer Graphics (SS2024) at the University of Vienna, where the Vulkan Tutorial is the starting point of our own Vulkan based engine implementation. The game is built as a server - client system using UDP for both sides to allow user control - as well as the transmission of the ffmpeg encoding to the clients decoder.
