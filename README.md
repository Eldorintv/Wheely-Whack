# Wheely-Whack

### Educational Project
This game was developed in combination of the courses Cloud-Gaming and Real-Time Computer Graphics (SS2024) at the University of Vienna, where the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) is the starting point for our own Vulkan based engine implementation. The game is built as a server - client cloud gaming system, uses UDP for network communication, and FFmpeg for video encoding and decoding. The project achieves its goal, though structure and implementation reflect a learning stage of a first self-made Vulkan game engine under time constraints.

## Game Info
Wheely-Whack is a fun 3D single player game where you are recklessly "driving" a car and try to avoid obstacles in front of you.
But be cautious, the car gets faster and faster!
